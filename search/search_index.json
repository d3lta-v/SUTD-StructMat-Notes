Elastic limit at point B is when the material stops being elastic and will start to deform plastically. </p> <p>The slides don't really differentiate between proportional and elastic limit because it is hard to differentiate between the point at which it no longer follows Hooke's Law (Reference: James Chapter 6 p. 154). </p> <p>Throughout this text we will use the term \"proportional limit\" and not \"elastic limit\" to refer to the end of linearity in the graph. ^9326f0</p> <p>[!WARNING] Not all materials have this shape of curve!
